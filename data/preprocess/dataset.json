[{"instruction": "Detect the sentiment of the content.", "input": "Hi all !Hey @Raju singh answering your question about the swap here\n\nThere is nothing announced yet regarding a swap, I'm sure you will be first to know if there is and we will make sure everyone is aware! No worriesA first view of the upcoming governance proposal / tokenomics of the aave protocolYes might not be clearBut a % of the fee will be redistributed to those who park liquidity to the backstopA stakers can withdraw the fees he earn, or put it in the backstop, but any liquidity in the backstop will itself earn part of feesYesGreat resumeYes the stakers will be subjected to different lock up period\n\nFees : stablecoins will be paid in stablecoins and volatile assets in ETH but this are parameters that could be changed by the governance", "output": "Positive"}, {"instruction": "Detect the sentiment of the content.", "input": "Helloooo", "output": "Neutral"}, {"instruction": "Detect the sentiment of the content.", "input": "Hey!There will be a specific post about the token swap as soon as the technical details are fully definedAll the specific details about governance will come in future postsNormally governance works, the more token you have, the more voting power, so I guess it wont be specific matter of min amount requiredOf course until the details are not released its not possible to confirm anythingLEND token core usage will be governance, also the token is used to deposit and borrow (collateral) in the protocol. Apart from this the protocol burn LEND tokens based on the fees gathered on a ratio of 80% of the fees gathered for the protocol are used to burn LEND.We are right now working on that, no specific date thoughIn this case its also related with MKR token volatilit itselfInitially was decided to take different popular and well known tokens also normally with good liquidity etc. We did a risk assesment with the addition to decide the parameters of each token:\nhttps://developers.aave.com/#risk-parameters-matrix\n\nIn general new assets addition will come with the implementation of our governance through LEND token. So LEND holders would be able to vote and propose on new additions, in this case new assets to add, their parameters etcThere is no specific ETA @9891.eth as soon as we have more details about this we will be releasing the specific tokenomics and governance documentation with it> Please, is the aave compound interest cycle a day?\n@9891.eth Second by second> This is the WP I refer to\n@Chris42Dao Of course, we will be giving all the details as soon as those are ready, but its not possible to specify the final details if those are not ready, I hope you can understand our point in that senseYes, that's it as soon as we have governance and tokenomics documentation ready we will be sharing with the community to get their feedback if you refer to LEND token, current implementation is phase 0 of the protocol. Phase 1 is coming adding governance through LEND token and after that phase 2 with full tokenomicsIts not something to be worried about @9891.eth is not matter of who is implementing governance before or after but the value that these governance and tokenomics add to the protocol in my opinionI think the ecosystem evolves quite fast, so its not so much matter of being the first that would make someone lose but the value added. In my opinion people is willing to move from one place to another based on the value addedYes, the idea is not make it perfect since the beginning, but needs to have at least a value and reasoning behind, not just release governance because it needs to be thereThe work began along with the release of the protocol, the idea is have more details in the coming 4-8 weeks but in my honest opinion its better to not give specific ETA etc to avoid expectations on the timing etc. We need to work daily based on the priorities that are coming. If for some reason we notice its required to move to improve the user experience or other thing from the platform and it needs to be done asap we would need to do that. So its not realistic to give a time frame, we need to work on what is priority for the protocolWe are transparent, we are working on the governance for the next phase on the protocol but its not worth to discuss on specific details when they are probable to change as those are still a work in progress, as soon as we release specific documentation with further details we would be able to discuss in more detail> Earlier I heard that you need to add some insurance, is there still?\n@geekery There are already options for insurance on the depositors side, as nexus mutual and opyn, but its something interesting to evaluate for future iterations of the protocolProtocol keys are handled by an Aragon DAO @Devin3 from 5 votes are required on the DAO for any update etc to be done on the protocol yesAlso @Chris Blec have a nice video about the overall topic of the admin keys of different protocols etc:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9fVIPhWj6c&t=1s\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1b9KwXfPPEgvpy2nxlpnLhtPMd7S5KfIx-hf4Hv77kBk/edit#gid=0> Is there a roadmap somewhere that shows Aave's plan to full decentralization?\n@Deleted User No, but to give some insights current phase is phase 0, after this one phase 1 is coming with governance and phase 2 with full tokenomics within the protocol. We will be giving more details when we release the tokenomics and governance documentation. We also released some details on our Ethereal summit presentation, you can find more details in this article:\nhttps://www.delphidigital.io/so/02N7mWeU_?cid=32549ba4-9679-4650-9fd5-c55422f3afc8#/main> Hi there, trying to understand the specifics regarding LEND vs aTokens. As I understand it, providing liquidity to a pool gives you a right to that pool's aToken which in turn starts giving you interest right away - that's clear. I can't however find anywhere in the white paper that owning LEND itself gives you a right to the \"dividends\" of the protocol the same way providing liquidity to individual pools does - owning LEND gives you only voting rights regarding governance. Purely from profit perspective (excluding potential rise in the price of LEND) wouldn't it make sense using my money to provide liquidity to pools instead of buying LEND itself? Am I missing something?\n@rb \nLEND token will be used to govern the protocol, we are currently working on the implementation of the governance apart from this it will be possible to be staked within the protocol to provide security/insurance to the protocol/depositors and that way earn staking rewards and fees from the protocol. Also currently LEND token is burnt based on the fees gathered in the protocol, so holders benefit on the reduction of the supply. We are working to release the specific documentation about tokenomics and governance for more details. Meanwhile this article may be helpful:\nhttps://www.delphidigital.io/so/02N7mWeU_?cid=32549ba4-9679-4650-9fd5-c55422f3afc8#/mainso you mean charting the \"market size\" right? TVL + BorrowingsWhen I have some spare time I would try to build it using Dune @Arthur0xYes, Mateo already helped me a lot understanding his queries, I hope to have some time to build a proper dashboard, if you have any specific query you would like to have ( already noted market size) let me knowthat one is already in Mateo's dashboard isnt it? I might be wrongor it was missing something I dont fully remember> Is there discussion of using LEND as a liquidity incentive token like COMP/BAL?\n@magic The final details about the upcoming governance and tokenomics are not public yet, this article may help you meawhile to understand what is coming:\nhttps://www.delphidigital.io/so/02N7mWeU_?cid=32549ba4-9679-4650-9fd5-c55422f3afc8#/main\n\nBut everything will be clear when the docs are released@Fineman the specific details are about to come, but as @Ken Lee pointed, the reward is for the holders insuring the protocol, its a way to incentive holders to insure the protocol and get rewarded due to that, so would benefit them instead of everyone as in the current burning model, anyway would be easier to discuss as soon as the documentation is publicly releasedThis is not similar to just a staking reward @Fineman your rewards also allow you to earn more rewards if you stake themanyway is better to move the debate when the tokenomics are released as right now its not possible to discuss about the topic properlyIs not possible to issue more LEND tokensif that happens would be a different tokenWhen did you \"join\"?I wasn't talking about priceThis was stated in early Maynot now @FinemanI know but Im pointing you that this was stated in early May, so, at least in my opinion, assuming that is the thing \"affecting\" LEND is wrongAnyway I avoid discussing about price personally I think there is too much speculation around to properly use price as a way to evaluate a proposal or token, anyway I would be glad to further discuss about the coming tokenomics once we have our tokenomics and governance documentation releasedCurrent LEND is capped, and the protocol already used 80% the fees it gathered - https://burn.aave.com/  - https://aavewatch.now.sh/Also the circulation supply doesn't matter at all, what it matters is the market cap to evaluate the valuehaving something at 10$ price with 1 million supply is the same as 1$ price at 10 million supplyIn which sense?lets move to #fa-ta-trading betterbut I dont get which scarcity you make with a 18 decimals tokenit can be splitted in the minimal amount you wantlets move to #fa-ta-trading> Is LEND token currently used for governance?

I understand incentivizing liquidity providers, but was confused by this terminology. Is this the difference of when someone toggles the use as collateral for their deposit?\n@DeFi Frog where is that said? I can't find \"borrow provider\"> I have two Lend separate wallets. On one I was able to stake. The other says not enough to stake. So how do I or what should I have done to have them both stakeable. I shouldve only blended them together before migration? No going backwards I guess now?\n@xIx is it possible that you are lacking ETH for the staking and that's the error coming?on a referral you normally have your own interface, or referral id and other users or activity is done over that referral IDso borrow provider means referral bringing borrow activity over their referral IDthis is the one I shared \nhttps://docs.aave.com/faq/#what-is-the-cost-of-the-serviceso flash loan + loan origination are the fees stablished right nowas far as I know it keeps that way, do you know @David T ?we are going to double check and update if required @Zer0dot Won't DM You First! thanksI can't recall 100% but looks accurate @Laur@angryBoredape the team is not getting more tokens over the migration, the aave reserve is for the safety incentives and ecosystem incentives, those tokens are not allocated for the team or any entity, you can check more here:\nhttps://medium.com/aave/aavenomics-eeab650cccc2\nhttps://docs.aave.com/aavenomics/\nhttp://governance.aave.com/> What is required to take a prtopsal through to a voting stage?\n@TMX https://governance.aave.com/t/aip-from-idea-to-implementation-to-execution/202> hey guys has anyone thought of translation of sites and documentation to chinese?\n@Brainyield site and app is already translated to chinesecirculating supply currently is 9M (as more tokens got migrated over the time), regarding that address I am not personally aware about the ownership of it, if I find out more I will let you knowHi @Johnny Sins ability to stake is only available for AAVE token but collateralization for LEND, as shown in the governance thread whenever is available AAVE as collateral and ability to migrate this would be easier for those users depositing their LEND as collateral> @bigbrotha I'm curious to hear how things are supposed to work there. From the proposal to the on-chain voting, what is the process? Who does/can decide to move it forward? Also it would be great to get more feedback from the team about the different points raised in the comments of the proposal. It would help people (or at least myself) to better understand the implications of using AAVE as collateral. Thanks! @Stani\n@URULE there is a thread about that here:\nhttps://governance.aave.com/t/aip-from-idea-to-implementation-to-execution/202> Not sure if this is the right spot to ask this question but why are we being encouraged to migrate our  lend coins to aAve at a loss will the aave team adjust the migration values to offset the decline in the new governance token? It's a random question I'm fairly new at this I have only been active for about three to five months but I migrated 50,000 flexa coins to amp and lost 30% of my investment knowing that amp will eventually increase but I see the same thing happening with lend to aave now... can someone give me an obvious reason why I should trade at a 60% to 70% decrease\n@Gee3rt5 Hello, the ratio is 100:1 the value over the tokens is expected to be following that ratio the same way, of course there might be minor differences between one or another but the value should tend to that ratio:\nhttps://coingecko.com/en/coins/aave\nhttps://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/aave-oldIt will be added @123jon there is discussion consolidating for that> @Pablo Won't DM you first Thanks. So regarding AAVE as a collateral, where are we now? There has been a discussion in the forum. Are we now waiting for someone to draft a proposal?\n@URULE when its consolidated its likely to come a proposal to be voted> @Pablo Won't DM you first  why does CoinGecko show 2\n> different market caps between lend and Aave then? It's showing 117m at 0.35 for lend and 337m at 35 for Aave?\n@BTCinthemoney LEND token (old) and AAVE token (new one) as there is a migration running from LEND to AAVE tokenyou mean same market cap in LEND and in AAVE tokens?I won't be the same as market cap is migrating from LEND to AAVEso over the time LEND market cap will be reducing and AAVE one growingyes> @Pablo Won't DM you first Thanks. I see it has been added as a collateral today. I don't understand. Was there a vote?\n@URULE @crypton  as the governance is still in the genesis governance/migration steps over the road map, the ability to do updates is still available by the genesis team, for example for highly requested and backed additions/updates as such, but when the full governance protocol is implemented any update or change would require to have its proper validation process over voting etc, here more details:\nhttps://docs.aave.com/aavenomics/ecosystem-overview#roadmap> How is the overall Marketcap calculated for Aave Token ?  Appreciate the help if possible thank you.\n@Joeydallday as other tokens, circulating supply * price per token> @mjc716 any word on this?\n@mjc716 offchain voting or governance might be fine for signaling or sentiment poll but I do not think its yet valid for final voting as it might be concerns on the voting process, for example to avoid double voting etc> Do we have a timeline for when V2 will be implemented?\n@kjac no, whenever is released it will be announced> Whats the percent quorum needed for aave improvement proposals\n@EtOHempire for the migration voting was 5% as it required a good consensus at least, for future proposals I would say at least 1% is a good threshold but this might be a topic to discuss over the governance forum to decide on this> Do we have a timeline for when V2 will be implemented?\n@kjac no, any news will be announcedCurrently no, as there is no liquidity incentive by now, this might come in the future (it is over the aavenomics proposal https://docs.aave.com/aavenomics/) and would be decided by token holders, there is discussion already over governance.aave.com forumnear 86% you can check at https://aave.com/there is no limit date currently for the migration to endthis might be set by the token holders at some point> Are there any good articles on Aave's governance procedures?\n@noodles http://docs.aave.com/aavenomics\nhttps://governance.aave.com (there is even a thread on creation of proposals/AIPs)> whats the gains % for staking? where can i find info?\n@tomato it varies depending on the amount staked/unstaked along the time currently is 5.2% APY> What is the actual process to get the governance discussions and ideas into an AIP? I must have missed that. Is there a set frequency or is it just an as and when type thing?\n@Eric https://governance.aave.com/t/aip-from-idea-to-implementation-to-execution/202@David T what was the status?No voting rewards implemented, but might be something to propose over governanceStill in the pipeline @FresiasHi @Fresias thanks for the feedback, it was actually expected to come earlier but as in any process there are priorities that comes up and need to be handled before, in this case migration/governace was quite important to focus on as it allows to decentralize the protocolheading to #espaol price discussion at #fa-ta-tradingVoting off-chain in my opinion is not a valid solution as the voting needs to be on-chain to trigger the action and for security purposesbut when credit delegation is allowedit would be easier for little token holders to delegate their vote so its used by whoever they delegate toevery loan is over collateralized, you can find a really good overview in general of risks in the risk framework:\nhttps://docs.aave.com/risk/Hi @ghosts_in_the_code updates on the parameter require governance agreement, you can suggest that over https://governance.aave.comyeshttps://docs.aave.com/faq/liquidationsaggregators as 1inch.exchange paraswap.io or dex.ag have available all atokens as far as I knowhttps://docs.aave.com/developers/integrating-aave/using-graphql\nhttps://docs.aave.com/developers/integrating-aave/using-blockchain-datayou can find the optimals of each asset:\nhttps://docs.aave.com/risk/liquidity-risk/historical-utilization\nAnd here:\nhttps://docs.aave.com/faq/depositing-and-earning#how-much-will-i-earn (spreadsheet linked)where are you referring @gghd ?collateral ratio for SNX in AAVE does not need to follow the same ratio as in Synthetixif its that what you refergovernance may decide on changes of parameters, based on the risk assesment performed by asset that is the actual LTV for SNX, but this might change or be updated if governance considersGovernance discussion is done over the governance forum at https://governance.aave.comno minimum limityou can use any AAVE amount you have to voteregarding the voting creation Im not fully sure about the minimum threshold to create itdo you remember @David T ?yes, staked tokens can be used to vote tooWell, anyone having AAVE token is trusting the protocol, same as any other protocol token, and of course if its over the stake you are even more involved in this sense as you are securing the protocol fundseach option has their own incentive so the incentives rate would differ from one to another based on the amount stakedyou can find them listed here:\nhttps://medium.com/aave/the-aave-protocol-v2-f06f299cee04the AIP needs to be published to appear in the governance section available to voteI think along with V2 governance inclusion it will come an easier process to handle those AIPsHey @DeFi Frog governance documentation is expected to come that would allow in an easier way to manage these requestsI personally consider the logical step is to build on top of V2 from now, so would be that wayover app.aave.com governance sectionover app-v1.aave.com you can find the previous votingsas it was over V1Hey, yes it is available here:\nhttps://docs.aave.com/developers/protocol-governance/governancethis guide might be helpful for you too @guruGAs far as I know it is quite more complex in the technical sense to add this capability to aAAVE as it is an asset that can be liquidated + minted over deposits etc @David T might give more details when backapp.aave.com over governance section, AAVE is the token to use to vote, LEND is deprecated so you should migrate your LEND to AAVE over the migration sectionThere is no airdrop, anyone notifying or reaching about an airdrop is a scammerHey @Deleted User you can find the governance docs regarding those questions here:\nhttps://docs.aave.com/developers/protocol-governance/governanceHi @DeFi Frog, pinging  @ABertoG that is more aware about the topic than me https://docs.aave.com/faq/#aave-aave-token\nhttps://docs.aave.com/aavenomics/@MatthewGraham https://app-v1.aave.com/governance/2-QmTSCQiNWJ3iVGvs4L4mVoLGP84UvGgcrrWi6uxhrcbj7XHello @0xDowning you can directly connect with the governance at governance.aave.comfor reaching the genesis team you can do at wecare@aave.combut as governance is decentralized you can reach it for example connecting over the forumYes, previous discussion to avoid bringing a voting for nothing is performed over governance.aave.com forumthen based on discussion, feedback and if its positive backed a on-chain voting might comeare you connecting with the correct wallet address? make sure in the top right corner as the app does detect the wallet balance and should alllow you to vote, also make sure your AAVE is not depositedno need to stake to vote but if you move the tokens during the voting process those won't countnot yet, but will be possiblenot the github account but the address that brings/propose on-chain the voting as far as I know 0.5% threshold or 2% for core changesIf you are voting yes, which is positive, and no, which is negative it is the same as just voting the difference between those, for example 100 yes 50 no, means 50 yesthere is no sense in voting in both sidesnew collateral types and features are been added by governance, best place to check is at governance.aave.comBy now no other benefit than having your vote used without spending transaction cost for the voting process as the delegate does that1) as it is right now 1100 AAVE per day for the staking rewards\n2) you mean in AAVE? There is no liquidity mining right now, so no AAVE rewards for borrowers or lenders\n3) Initially was 400 AAVE, upgraded 550 AAVE per day and since ABPT staking option launch 1100 AAVE per daydo you know @David T ?you can propose that over governance.aave.comHi @Daniel Ocean that depends on the governanceyeswhat do you mean?

any upgrade/update to the protocol requires an AIP, and Aave genesis team does not decide on that, so even if the team somehow is contrary to a decision if there is enough 'yes' to get it there it will be performed anywayprobably the best way to handle this at this stepwould be a proper risk analysis to back this ideaas I assume that's the main point, making sure a change like that is not risky for the protocolah got it, yes, I assume would need some tech help, from the ecosystem itself, genesis team or similaralthough its trivial its something to do and have some kind of feedback over the governance forumI mean, you can bring an AIP without discussionbut I don't expect it to be backed that way@ABertoG maybe you are aware of the best steps to recommendits worth to bring the discussion @MiLLi no worries, maybe sUSD deserves an upgrade or not, the discussion is positivethe best place would be the governance forum but its fine to bring discussion here too, it is this specific channel purpose, I have tagged @ABertoG as she can bring further information regarding this topic, as soon as she is able she will check Reserve factor is the fees that the protocol is accruing to build its protocol fund, to dedicate part of it to the staking reward is up to AAVE token holders to decide over governance@tomuky feel free to bring a discussion thread over the governance forumgovernance.aave.comIts something that might be proposed by the governance, feel free to bring the discussion at governance.aave.comno, you can find the details in the AIP descriptionbased on the contract it seems its a multisig, but not aware who is the ownerHi @iBased the rewards are already weight, the highest reward asset is USDC actuallyits just that as there is a lot of more liquidity of USDC, then the rewards are splitted moreI dont think the rewards will be reweight and anyway if it does users might affect the rate based on higher utilizationprotocol has security mechanisms to 'stop' the protocol but not to perform changes, so this would allow the protocol to stop and allow the AIP required changes to be performed to fix whatever occurstime will tell if there is further versions, I personally think there is still long period in front of V2Yes, as long as the voting is open you can voteany amount higher than 0 should be validare youc onnecting with the correct wallet address?and/or in the correct networkand marketin the top right corner you can consult the connected addressand by its side the marketif for some reason its having a bit of delay it might be possible but should not be the casecould you click on 'more' and select light modemaybe its relatedah yep, that's itgood that you asked I missed thatI will confirm but I think that's the reasonYes, I just checked, it is that @dreththere are 2 different votes, 0.5% quorum and 2% quorumno, as those are not scheduled yetHi @MiLLi my personal thoughts, usually AIPs have at least a decent discussion over the governance forum which is linked in the AIP, I feel this one lacks discussion from the ecosystem/communityPersonally I do not consider it safe enough to be included, at least until new mechanisms are within the protocol, for example in the last community call from grants DAO were proposed somelike borrow capah wait, the AIP brings it as no collateral I see no?ok, then its differentfor some reason I was thinking it was enabled as collateralwhich is the concerning partwell, it is a decentralized governance, it does not belong to just one participant to lets say mark as good or bad something its totally up to AAVE holdersOn our side we try to be as much active as possibleby the way grants DAO was also created so lot of community driven proposals can come from therein the end holders could connect to each other the way they consider convenienthttps://aavegrants.org/ah waitits not linked their telegram tooas discord points herehttps://t.me/aavegrantsdaoI suggest you to reach them therebut that is quite impossible, I mean genesis team is a participant as others, does not have further legitimaticy than others or similar, and its not scalable neither realistic to be able to oversight all the proposals that might comethere are a lot of proposals and discussions around, and way more I would expect in the futureas pointed this is my personal viewI think Aave grants DAO is a great start point to bring even more material, and everything that is needed in governance sensea) vote would be cancelledb) vote won't be possible, you need to have the tokens before the AIP goes liveto give more info about a) there is a verification of votings after voting period, where that is checkedIts likely governance forum is the best place to catch up with the latest + community calls whenever those are donehttps://governance.aave.comI suggest you to check at https://governance.aave.com if its not there already you can bring the discussion yourselfYou mean adding new assets to AMM market? that would need to go over governance proposalFrom the docs Currently the Short time lock executor is 3 days and the Long time lock executor is 10 days.Its possible, but he needs to have also voting powerthere is proposition and voting powerproposition only allows to bring the voting live, voting power allows proposition + votingwould require an AIP to update thosethey did not change that much aloong the timehere a recap from changes from v1 to v2https://docs.aave.com/risk/asset-risk/risk-parameters#risk-parameters-changethen since instance of governance any update can also be checked from the AIP that did itin app.aave.com there is a governance sectionwhere you can check previous AIPsthere were some AIPs over V1 but mainly to bring alive V2 governanceI dont think any of them changed any parameters@poolmonster you need to have those AAVE/stkAAVE before the proposal went liveotherwise you can't vote using thosewhat do you mean with 'in isolation'? Current AIP aimed to add it without any isolation as it was adding it as collateral or what do you refer?This is already possible, your AAVE tokens staking in the stake AAVE option can be used to vote stillor in other words 'stkAAVE' can be used to vote tooYou would need to wait for specific details about the marketHey @Cato over https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth any holder with 0.5 AAVE or above could create a voting off-chain for signaling of proposals, basically evaluate the sentiment of a proposal before becoming liveThat voting was only a signaling over snapshot, there is no ETA neither certainty it would be done unless there is a team that works on thatyou may want to ask whoever bringed the voting livethat's a good flow indeedgovernance vote is the 'hardest' as requires the actual code to be deployed + threshold of AAVE proposition power to bring the on-chain voting liveyou can find the info here https://docs.aave.com/governance/unfortunately not really, would depend on whoever from the ecosystem is taking steps to get enough proposition power + also deploying a markte instance in that new network, both those 2 steps are not easy to be doneHi @SpicySoup best you could do is find out over the governance forum whether someone from the ecosystem is actively working on it or nothttps://governance.aave.comyou could use tools as Dune analytics to fetch all the voting transactions and get average cost from therefrom where did you get that idea? just in case some information is wrongbut basically is up to AAVE holders (governance) to decide on suchsorry what do you mean with polygon first dapps?they could do if they would like, its an open ecosystem, or if you refer to any incentive for those that would come from Aave grants DAO or governancebut if the idea is those dapps to go to L1 that could go easily over governance in L1 no?also proposals for polygon network could be driven in Ethereum networkor using snapshot as way to evaluate the sentiment over a votingyes, why not? Im maybe missing somethingah, you mean adding new assets, over snapshot and AIP would be a good start yes, but yet polygon market is not under governance as would need governance structure in that network firstthere is a testing AIP to set up test governance to try out that mechanismyou can find at app.aave.com/governanceand discussion is going around at governance.aave.com@0x0x its stated in the rules channel, do not spam the same message over several channels, to formal vote to go live depends on whoever party from the ecosystem with enough proposition power goes to the AIP process, so basically there is no time to give you may want to ask whoever ruled the snapshot voteThere is no inflation unless the governance decides for itnot sure what are you referring from DyDx honestly, you should ask them regarding their protocolcould you share the URL or place where did you found that information regarding AAVE token?Basically there is no governance contract or instance to transfer the keys in those networks, you might want to check this:\nhttps://twitter.com/AaveAave/status/1430945859034705922short time lock proposal 0.5% proposition power, and long one is 2%Any new proposal depends on governance, you could even propose yourself over governance.aave.comcriteria for what? https://docs.aave.com/governance/Each chain has its token usually those come from the bridge, the one that belongs to the governance as it is right now is the one in ethereumdepending on how the AIP affects the protocol the AIP would require short or long timelock, for example if the AIP would update critical parts of the protocol would require it to be long timelock executorwhat do you mean?Higher delay time, and higher threshold of proposition power and voting to approve the proposalsHere @fig | Flipside Crypto shared a pretty good summaryI think its actually 15% but yes from total supplyYou can migrate from LEND to AAVE at https://app-v1.aave.com -> migration portalMake sure to have ETH for the transaction cost.\n\nThere are also alternative services allowing the migration as:\n\nhttps://www.myetherwallet.com/interface/dapps/lend-migrator\n\nhttps://app.mycrypto.com/migrate/aave\n\nOver Binance (access might depend on your residency) that allow LEND deposits and conversion to AAVE.\nhttps://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/17595222999545348c8acdd5dc41c00a\n\nIf you are elegible the cheaper option is likely to be over Binance.@Im_Mortal and avoid spamming same message everywhere, its in #rulesthat would depend on the team that bringed the proposalas it is right now no, unless a mechanism to allow that is bringed by governanceHey @Anika | she256 you may want to also bring it over the governance forum (if you did not do already) at https://governance.aave.comnot sure which market you refer but basically governacne, so AAVE holders could decide upon new markets, deployments in other networks etc over governance decisionYou dont need AAVE tokens to bring ideas or proposals to the forumHey @Ivan best place to ask would be the governance forum thread for AIP 44\nhttps://governance.aave.com/t/aip-44-discussion/5965On-chain, so over AIPs each voteover snapshot is free, as its by signatureAny of you could write that over the governance forum is not something only devs could do, anyone could bring discussion and proposal over the forumshows correctly nowhow are you triggering the flash loan?if you are coding the best place is #developersits the interface having some troubles to display, you can report any interface trouble at https://github.com/aave/aave-ui/issuesHi @gain_ito there is certain amount of AAVE tokens as reward, 550 AAVE per day per staking optionimagine that you are the only people staking with 1000 AAVE staked, you would receive the whole 550 AAVE per day,\n\nNow someone else stakes another 1000 AAVE, then you both would receive 275 AAVE per day as you are staking 50% each of us of the totalquite simple example but so you get the ideahttps://etherscan.io/address/0x25f2226b597e8f9514b3f68f00f494cf4f286491do you mind asking over #developers ?  this is the github link but they might be able to give further insights https://github.com/aavewhich stuff you refer is missing?You can find threads of discussion regarding that at governance.aave.comas far as I know you cant, but the token might have the capabilities to allow that, would require governance to allow that token to do that of courseyou should ask over aavegotchi communityregarding what they show there its better to ask them, I recall that there was a vote at https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth regarding the topic but after this whoever bringed the vote needs to keep working on the proposalso better to ask is the proposal creatorI dont think it would, but better to ask in V3 governance thread in the forum https://governance.aave.com/t/introducing-aave-v3/6035if that's the case then I dont think it was even bringed to AAVE holders to vote, that would be the logic 1st step to dofeel free to join the governance forum V3 thread to ask about itany addition to the protocol belongs to governance, its unknown to give a reply to such as basically would depend on AAVE holders decision over votingI referred to you to that thread as that way you could contact/discuss with the people proposing such detailsI suggest you to ask whoever bringed that proposal live to follow up the advanceyou asked wen optimism, and basically as any other proposal, addition, feature etc that decision belongs to governance (AAVE holders), I thought you asked because you read somewhere that it was suggested to governance already, but if it wasnt you can bring the topic by yourself directly to the governance forum available at governance.aave.comIt depends on you, whether you want to bring the topic, Im just replying you how decentralized governance works, there is no entity to ask when its something going to be done but getting implicated as other holders or community in the processAvalanche had a snapshot voting https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/QmWo6yQyJtVWXTExHPR7RpY9Zj6tFdRsUN7EhCLmkFotcHalso there was an AIP to bring guardians to hold the keys for the marketbut basically code is open source, so markets to be bringed does not actually need a voting to come live, but of course if the governance does not back such market it couldnt be considered technically part of Aave decentralized protocolAvalanche market was already deployed some time ago, its live at app.aave.comcurrently there are 2 markets in ethereum V2 and AMM, and 1 polygon network market and 1 in avalanchehttps://aavenews.substack.com/ is a good place to get weekly reports of aave protocol@John Murphy AAVE token and Aave protocol are decentralized there is no partnership or cooperation to be done by Aave company on behalf of the protocol:\nhttps://twitter.com/AaveAave/status/1433869388889743360\nonly AAVE holders over governance decide on the protocol or any entity from Aave protocol as its grants DAO for instance https://aavegrants.org/ or governance forum at https://governance.aave.com@Shreyas  maybeaave news comes from aave grants DAO you can find way to contact at aavegrants.org for example over their telegram chataddition of assets decision belongs to governance, here more info https://docs.aave.com/governance/guides/new-asset-listingYes, Short time lock executor is 0.5% and the Long time lock executor is 15%.most of the AIPs are short time lock, long time lock is only for those affecting core parts of the protocol or tokenif we go strict to the technicality, there is no need of anything to deploy an Aave market, as basically Aave protocol is open source, but if someone would like that market deployed to be 'approved' by Aave governance, so holders, then yes at least a voting would be needed to show this positive sentiment/approvaltalking ni specific about V2 hereI think the main difference is that in V3 people might be stopped to deploy without permission, but in terms of process I think it works in a similar way, you can check here the discussion about this topic https://governance.aave.com/t/aave-v3-launch-strategy-code-licensing/6316and here there was a sentiment voting about the license for V3 https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0x483f30ac318ac7e26fbc9804a48ccd9126078d19c91f19a53c56aeacb7689f4ayep, usually the forum discussion is usually the 1st stepI know  I remember you @EzR3aL since really long time, its really cool to see you involvedjust put a little reply in #general https://discord.com/channels/602826299974877205/602826300813606923/931584123850596372by now on-chain only AAVE and stkAAVE from Ethereum network can be usedover snapshot there is further list of assets, including aAAVE also polygno, avalanche assets, stkABPT etcthis is already live afaikno ETA, you can join the discussion in the governance forum, there was a snapshot voting alreadyHey @state are you aware whether avAave was added in snapshot?I see stkABPT was added and the avalanche voting seems to be earlierwhat do you mean? stkABPT is the token that represents staking in the ABPT staking optionnot related to Avalanchenothere was just one vote in snapshot by now, you may want to join the governance forum and ask over there any party involved in the processgovernance forum its at https://governance.aave.comCurrently the Short time lock executor is 0.5% and the Long time lock executor is 2%.proposition power*https://docs.aave.com/governance/just replied at https://discord.com/channels/602826299974877205/602826300813606923/934084923088838686I am not admin in snapshot so I can't say but let me ping them again@monetsupply @state are you aware of this snapshot voting ?\nhttps://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0xb3227fe4d3ad7505a3ad3077fe141e603e22b9714c22ef3b12a3e77321b2117fit got positive back to add AAVE and aAAVE from avalanche as voting power for snapshot, was it too low threshold?any rewards could be decide by governance, but I dont think it would make sense to reward for using testnet, or maybe Im not understanding you wellas any listing that depends on governance decision you can bring the discussion yourself at governance.aave.comV2 at https://testnet.aave.com/\nV3 at https://v3-test.aave.com/I dont think it was suggested but anyone could do that over the governance forumthat's market size not TVLyou are mixing termsthey would need to follow the same process as others did, governance proposal, voting etc https://docs.aave.com/governance/a governance proposal would be needed, as the last one to add SEBA for example https://app.aave.com/#/governance/59-QmRw3MDvmjqyX825Yyw6chbXoQ9DcE4yjEoj48FEv3vWG7yes, governance is open to anyone to propose or bring discussions around, you might want to propose yourself at governance.aave.comas snapshot does not trigger any change in the protocol, is just to evaluate the sentiment it does not need so strict requirementsthe problem would be on the delegator side, you should never delegate without trusting the party you are delegating tocredit delegation relies on trust relation or binding agreement or any other kind of enforcement, for example on-chain contract acting as security for any otehr kind of collateral etcthe APR comes from certain amount per day of stkAAVE tokens that is splitted between depositors/borrowers for certain assetso basically the calculation comes from x stkAAVE / day per asset and \"action\" (borrow/deposit)which is splitted to the participants of that oneit comes from governance decisionhere the last updatehttps://app.aave.com/#/governance/60-QmXBgxpgMCfHngBgsmd3HX3rvpu9E3kR4FSxZbQkoVM2unit would need a price feedI would suggest you to follow what 'HAL' did, the same flow they did, they basically did governance forum discussion, then snapshot voting, then merge request, that would usually be the expected flowyou can find about HAL in the governance forum and their snapshot votingthere is no different version of safety module, there is no v1 or v2 version, this might be a good read https://docs.aave.com/aavenomics/safety-modulehttps://docs.aave.com/developers/v/2.0/protocol-governance/staking-aaveI replied to you already in a different channel @Mr.Mworks in a same way for your question @daverat https://discord.com/channels/602826299974877205/712242009162907658/966283022850736148in snapshot (sentiment only voting) there is no minimum to vote, but I recall 50 AAVE to create a votingon-chain, so executions, there is a threshold to create proposals, but for voting there is no threshold, so no minimumyes, on-chain governance is on ethereum networkbut for snapshot you can vote using polygon tokens tooyes, governance right now is only available in ethereum mainnet, there is no minimum to vote with, but of course pretty little amount might not be economically viable given ethereum transactions costif you refer to Aave companies you can contact at wecare@aave.comno time frame, usually the team that bringed the snapshot is the one expected to bring the on-chain voting for that, maybe they lack enough AAVE for this processusually that's the flow, snapshot is voting to evaluate the sentiment of a proposal then if positive after that there is on-chain votinghttps://docs.aave.com/governance/that's how the rate works, the higher the utilization the higher the rate, as most of the USDT is borrowed the rate goes higher, that would incentive repayments or new depositshttps://docs.aave.com/risk/liquidity-risk/borrow-interest-rateI would say in the forum thread linked to the proposalnot sure if there is a dashboard in dune analytics, but it allows you to fetch based on which type of rate was usedit was not even voted yet, as any governance proposal its there availabel to discuss, feel free to join the governance threadit was just proposed you can just join the governance forum thread and have your say therebasically you can't vote with AAVE/stkAAVE (or delegated) that you got after the creation of the proposal @0xDin that proposalI might be wrong but I think the UI displays based on your timezone, is this correct @DeFi Spartan ?there is no governance team in specific but there are many ecosystem contributors, some examples are BGD Labs, or Aave grants DAO for example, one place to start might be in the governance forum, and of course reading the governance docs at https://docs.aave.com/governance/what are your doubts? maybe I can help or direct to who might knowif its dev related #developers might be the best placenot sure what you refer in specific to core team, as anyone could contribute to the protocol but basically over governance proposals teams could postulate themselves to contribute to the protocol and receive funds from it, some examples might be grants DAO, BGD Labs, Certora, etcyou can find proposals discussion in the governance forum at governance.aave.com then proposals been voted in snapshot and AIPs in the app directlymy bad, there was no vote yetits under discussion still in the governance forumcorrect, I would say this is quite normal flow, it would depend on the discussion over the governance forum normallyno worries, also we just synced a bot to push any governance voting over snapshot to #governance so it would be easier to follow new proposals coming there not by the grants DAO, grants DAO has certain budget to give grants but the protocol collector contract holds way more funds that can be used to more proposals to further develop the protocol etc, those can be propsoed by governance votingAave companies is the team that originally bringed Aave protocol, which now is fully decentralized so anyone could contribute to the protocol development and growthcertain markets can't be managed by Ethereum governance (at least yet), those are handled by the Guardians multisig, which members were decided by a governance voting over snapshotthere is an \"ecosystem reserve\" contract, and also several \"collector contracts\" holding the fees coming from the reserve factoryou can find holders for example using etherscan holders tab for a tokenthen input those addresses in tools as debank.com or zapper to check the assets history etcyou can manually just avoid those, they are usually labelled or shown as contractssearch for stkAAVE token in etherscanthere is a holders tabhttps://etherscan.io/token/0x4da27a545c0c5b758a6ba100e3a049001de870f5#balancesas it is right now its not possible, would need a govenance voting to enable that if governance wishessnapshot is sentiment voting, so its not a voting that would executed any change in the protocol, but AIPs (so on-chain voting, the ones showm at https://app-v3.aave.com/governance/) indeed execute changes in the protocolyou should be able to vote and/or delegate with stkAAVEyou need enough funds to pay back initial loan + growing interest, in testnet you acn just mint additional assets to pay back the whole debtgas fees for using the network, ETH in Ethereum network, MATIC in Polygon, AVAX in Avalanche etcin testnet you can just mint more tokensand real scenario you would just get from somewhere else, DEX swapping any token, using the repay with collateral feature or whatever way you considerIt depends on what you refer with Aave Team, if you refer to Aave companies, as a company it has its own structure and decision making, if you are referring to Aave protocol, as its decentralized there is no official team, anyone could basically contribute to the protocol and even get monetary or any other resources from a governance proposal, there are already several governance proposals like this, some examples might be Aave grants DAO team, BGD Labs, Certora, Gauntlet etcThere was no proposal to perform that, so in theory I would say its not, there were recent discussions for SM to cover further markets apart from the market that existed when it was deployed (v2)I can't speak on behalf of decentralized governance, but that would be my guessif I recall well in the proposals you can find the list of addresses that votedin etherscan in the token page you can find \"holders\" tab theresnapshot is just for sentiment evaluation, there is no set threshold to pass, but usually would be logic to expect a decent positive response before bringing this to an AIP (on-chain voting)ABPT as you are depositing in BalancerAAVE/ETH 85/15 then indeed there might be impermanent loss as in any AMM, you have just AAVE staking option if you wish to avoid this2 - not fully sure, in terms of transactions usually would be creating the proxy for the pool in balancer, then approve both assets (wrap ETH to WETH if needed too) deposit into Balancer, then stake BPT into staking contract (approval required too here)for normal staking is just approve AAVE, stake AAVEapprovals are usually quite cheap in comparison with other kind of more complex transactionssending ETH is around 22K gas, approvals might be from 50K to 100K or around thatso usually 2x to 5x what cost sending ETH@ngmi.fund the proposal comes with explanation and motivation from who is proposing that https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-aave-v3-fantom-freeze-reserves/9166/1so the best would be joining the forum thread and checking the info there, and if you wish to know more you can participate thereI am not aware of that@offline I checked the thread and the transfer is done from the own wallet address, that means the wallet got compromised, not related with Aave protocol at all but someone stealing your private keyHey @0xkmack given that Aave is a decentralized protocol, you can direct such proposals to protocol governance or for example any entity as Grants DAO. \nhttps://aavegrants.org/\nhttps://docs.aave.com/governance/\nhttps://governance.aave.com/usually the best way is bringing a post over the governance forum and based on the feedback there doing a snapshot voting to evaluate the sentimentyou can find it here https://docs.aave.com/governance/aipsI suggest you to bring your opinion and feedback directly into the governance forum thread, also Harmony bringed one thread in their own governance forum that is also linked there https://governance.aave.com/t/harmony-horizon-bridge-exploit-consequences-to-aave-v3-harmony/8614Hey @0xNacho feel free to share it over here and other channels, we are trying to set up a channel for AIPs also to be publicly exposed there but its a bit harder to make it automatic, I did not find any bot to push those in discord automaticallyafter refreshing a couple of times does it work?might be temporary failing the responsebut eventually works on my end at leastIt seems to be something on snapshot interface end, I reported to them over their discordin which proposals did it fail for you @mcfly ?it seems there was an issue on snapshot site, in theory they just fixed it, could you make sure to clear cookies/cache on the site and check again?yes, the proposal seem to be for Ethereum mainnet onlyif you mean the liquiditiy incentives, those come from OP team, might be best to ask them, if you are asking about the funds granted to the protocol I think aave grants DAO was the team managing those, you can find them at https://aavegrants.org/there is no minimum AAVE to vote for a proposalof course pretty little amount for on-chain voting might not make sense given there is a transaction cost for using the networkAave protocol is transparent, its not possible to withdraw given that whole liquidity was borrowed, as pointed in #general there are threads where you can participate and follow the discussionbasically that Aave protocol would only remain in PoS (as its doing right now) and there was a voting to disable ETH borrowing too (there is one to enable it back again)it was executed yesterdayand regarding snapshot you can use some additioanl tokens too as AAVE from Polygon and Avalanche at https://snapshot.org/#/aave.ethat app.aave.com -> governance section, you can participate on those thereits only on ethereum network those votingsBGD Labs team does a review of each proposals code at https://github.com/bgd-labs/seatbelt-for-ghostsit seems to be wrong

grants dao, chaos labs, gauntlet etc, but regarding your questions, most of the things you ask you can query them directly using tools as dune analytics or directly on-chain, delegation is an on-chain action and you can easily query those events to do those analysisthose contributors might be happy to reply here, but I feel they are more active in the governance forumyou may want to reach them directly, some of them are teams/companies with their own contact methods in their sites, but usually they tend to be more active in the governance forumbut Im not really understanding the reasoning to ask a specific team when Aave protocol is decentralized and not ruled or owned by us, basically AAVE holders govern Aave protocol, Aave protocol governance delegation is something in line with the DAO strategy and that is not decided by any specific team but by decentralized governance, anyone is able to delegate their voting via app.aave.com or directly interacting with Aave protocol contractsin addition anyone can postulate themselves to become a delegatee people usually do that in the governance forumthere is even a section for it at https://governance.aave.com/c/delegate-platforms/27It seems like that, here some context

As I understand it, providing liquidity to a pool gives you a right to that pool's aToken which in turn starts giving you interest right away - that's clear. I can't however find anywhere in the white paper that owning LEND itself gives you a right to the \"dividends\" of the protocol the same way providing liquidity to individual pools does - owning LEND gives you only voting rights regarding governance. Purely from profit perspective (excluding potential rise in the price of LEND) wouldn't it make sense using my money to provide liquidity to pools instead of buying LEND itself?

From borrowers, a 0.25% of the loan amount is collected on loan origination, from which 20% is used for referral integrators and 80% is swapped to LEND token and burned. From flash loans, a 0.35% is collected from the loan amount, from which 90% is redirected as extra income for depositors of the protocol and 10% is splitted using the same 20%/80% model of the origination fee. There also exist transaction fees related with the Ethereum Blockchain usage, these fees depend on the network status and transaction complexity.I agreeI saw Compound token and thats a bit different thing as it's practically early exit for the team and investors whereas we are more releasing aavenomics which includes monetary policies and other important things that are important for the growth of the ecosystem.@joeismyname the feedback look idea is to price the inflation/incentive upon protocol grows. The more the protocol grows in debt the more it needs security and the more incentivized the securing the protocol becomes, creating a value loop.> And this graphic implies some kind of relationship between the market cap of LEND and the total pool size? \n> \n> Total market cap of lend = total amount of USD that can be insured in the pools?\n@joeismyname In terms of the total market cap of lend = total insured value might not be concrete as the protocol can be partially insured or even same debt capital insured by multiple times depending on the value of LEND market capitalization. What is interesting is that the incentives are like thrust engines that are adjusted based the need for securing the protocol. These incentives drives adoption for obtaining LEND to secure the protocol since there is incentive (inflation/fee sharing)@tooney still open a bit but eventually we're going to make the migrations as easy as possible @satstacker84 currently the APR for LEND is 0 as it's mostly used as a collateral (and cant be borrowed atm due to up coming migration).

How do we delegate or is there any way around paying an ETH fee to vote?hi guys, I am trying to get in touch with the treasury team at AAVE, would anybody know someone there please?Thanks for your reply, I was indeed talking about the protocol fees. Thanks for the precision @Pablo Won't DM you first Im planning to borrow money and use aave as collateral.. its a long term loan. What do I do to make sure my collateral will not get liquidated? Its a 1-2yr loanproviding liquidity -> you add assets to a protocol and receive whatever the protocol is paying for that (swap fee for pools, apy for lending, etc.)\n\nliquidity mining -> you do the same but the project is incentivizing you by giving out extra rewards, usually in the form of emissions of some governance token, so i guess the term relates to  you somehow 'mining' those rewardsCan you help me to withdraw cash to my account?\nHi\n<@Randy2122>\n\nyou shouldnt be confused with doing that as you can get that done on your dashboard.\n\nIf you are not seeing it on your dashboard it simply  be Means that your wallet address is not on the right derivative path with our newly updated system.hi guys @here\nWould appreciate your feedback and voting on this ARC proposal\nhttps://governance.aave.com/t/arc-proposal-to-add-mln-as-a-reserve-asset/4188https://9000.hal.xyz/it allows setting up notifications for a variety of protocolsThis is helpful. Thanks\n\nIs there anyone from the community or the team who is able to assist with it? Have a few Qs\nI'm pioneering MLN proposal\nhttps://governance.aave.com/t/arc-proposal-to-add-mln-as-a-reserve-asset/4188AIP 12 voting is now live!https://app.aave.com/governance/18-QmZZ7JqvEx99u7dMNFPBBnew3BgepLCmXRMrNi8y5ndpXnBig supporter of this myself, Ampl should act in a manner unlike any other asset of Aave, and aAMPL's unique qualities will allow it to be an important building block for all sorts of innovative defi applications. \n\nI think this proposal will greatly benefit both the Aave protocol, and Aave token holders, and further Aave's innovative reputation!You can stake your Aave in the safety module for yeild, doing that provides 'insurance' for the protocolhttps://docs.aave.com/aavenomics/safety-moduleVoting for AIP-26 is now live!https://app.aave.com/governance/23-QmVXVtoDGzNtAPDCTWg7vYaezadKwsuHLrbgaTDRESQKzBThis proposal would greatly increase the amount of fees going to the Aave protocolWhile the current increase rate cap has limited ampl's market size on Aave, this proposal would raise that limiter greatly, bringing millions more ampl into the protocolEven with the small market size now, ampl's high interest rate causes a disproportionately large amount of fees to be collected by the protocol, this proposal would increase that even more!This would also help combat the unhealthy high utilization rate that we see when ampl is in positive rebaseSo this proposal helps to ensure lenders have better liquidity, and can pull their amples out of Aave in a wider range of market conditionsTo weigh in on the whole BOND debate, I think it's entirely reasonable to vote 'nay' on the proposal. Bond is a great asset, and their relationship with Aave is mutually beneficial, but enabling it to be used as collateral would be risky. \n\nBond has a low market cap, and not a lot of liquidity, and allowing loans to be collateralized with bond could potentially result in loans becoming undercollatoralizedI'd vote Yay if bond were to put up another proposal just listing Bond for borrowing, without enabling collatoralI don't think the attacks on people who voted Nay are at all warranted eitherHalf of the nay votes came from defimaximalist.eth and defiwhale.eth, two separate entities, and the rest of the nay votes were from smaller walletsThose two wallets make up less than 2% of Aave total supplyI don't think painting this as 'whales control everything' is quite accurate, there were plenty of wallets voting against thisThe bigger problem is holder apathy, gas costs of voting, and inability to vote if you're providing liquidity. 95% of aave out there did not vote on this proposal.On the topic of voter apathy, please vote for AIP-26 and 27! There is less than 100,000 Aave voting on those proposals rn, and Aip-26 will cause a ton more fees to be paid to the Aave protocol!I don't know honestly, it's a hard problem to solveOffering things like financial benefits to voters isn't ideal either, and it would lead to large amount of misinformed votes from people just looking to make $Can someone explain to me why newly voted on stkAAVE LM rewards for defi coins like LINK and sUSD aren't showing up in the appthe rewards has shown in the app briefly but not long after and sinceDo you know if theyre able to award retroactive rewards for the missed time?Or if thats the plan reallyhttps://app.boardroom.info/aave/proposal/cHJvcG9zYWw6YWF2ZTpkZWZhdWx0OjM2AIP 35 voting is live, this aip would fix the interest rate curve of ampl, which was affected by an unexpected quirk in the way Aave calculates interestBasically, this quirk caused the apy cap to be orders if magnitude higher than it should be, and for the lending market to work properly, the apy cap needs to be set to a more reasonable valueEncourage you all to vote on this proposal while gas is low!i only see 2 replies and nothing else really. does aave vote? where can i read the discussion? do i need to be logged in?\nwhen can we expect fantom to be implemented on aave?but that vote is from fantom, not from aavecan anyone help me with flash loans please nomatter what i do my stuff jstu wont workmetamaskhttps://governance.aave.com/t/arc-bring-ampl-to-avalanche-market/6271New proposal is up to bring Ampl to the Avalanche Aave v2 marketI am very much in favour of this proposal, ampl has been a very significant source of revenue for the Aave protocol, and this would allow Aave to continue to grow this revenue streamThere's also been lots of discussion about tweaking ampl interest rate parameters recently, the avalanche market provides an opportunity to experiment this as well^ +1, also curiousvery excited about getting on the aave ecosystem!https://governance.aave.com/t/aampl-faq-improving-ux-and-decreasing-information-asymmetry/6467to address the poor user experience resulting from a lack of readily accessible information regarding the behaviour of the ampl market, i've created a FAQ answering the most common questionsId like this FAQ to be easy to find, and for that reason I propose a link to this FAQ be included on the Aave frontend for the AMPL marketIf you simply search through this discord for posts about this market, you can see there's a significant amount of confusion about this market. Some users are angry, and feel tricked, while its easy to *say* users should do their research before participating in the market, information about this market is very difficult to find, and there's little indication that thier market acts differently on the Aave frontendThat's why I created this FAQI'd really appreciate any feedback, suggestions for improving the faq, and help in getting it added to the frontend, I think this would greatly reduce confusion and improve user experienceHelloHello guys, The Dapp List is enabling community-first tokens to distribute the governance power in its curation mechanism.

Keep an eye on https://governance.aave.com for that info.Not at the moment, only AAVE and stkAAVE, but this is a good question.CorrectNon ETH markets, since the AIP deployer is only on ETH.Portals are not yet live.I think in gas costs to perform transactions.Unless you have a link to the article?Check https://governance.aave.comGenerally no.Never to date, but read https://docs.aave.com/faq/migration-and-staking to get a handle on the risk.Yep, then you can vote on any of the proposals.Generally the execution happens within a couple of days, so expecting it to happen soon.Where are you seeing this metric?Responded in general.#developersShould be there now It will be automatic.Could be immediately, I don't think there is a minimum delay.Ahh yeah thanks  - I was thinking of snapshot votes.It's going to be executed soon, and definitely before the merge.YesYes from the time the vote has passed.Hey, I don't know about this, where is the source of the info?Snapshot votes do not consume gas, AIP governance proposals do.Thanks, prompted me to add a governance section in #faq-and-linksNo, you can just buy Aave from the market if that's what you want to do. Proposals are for making changes to the protocol.Feel free to propose your idea on the governance forums\nhttps://governance.aave.com/https://docs.aave.com/faq/Probably best to start there You can check at https://app.aave.com/ for the various markets.Probably best to start here\nhttps://docs.aave.com/faq/\n\nYou only need collateral if you want to borrow.You should be able to vote, unless you just bought the AAVE and the vote has already started.Probably ask in #developers  Hey @JAM - you might get more traction posting this on https://governance.aave.com/ if nobody responds.Try asking in #developersInterestingThere hasn't been an event yet, if there was it would be communicated (and voted) via governance.\nYou can check #faq-and-links for analytics that include SM deposits In snapshot or on app.aave.com?Okay cool, glad you got it sorted Snapshot votes are gasless.Ahh right, they are separate. Generally this is the flow. \n\nIdea -> Snapshot -> AIP (on chain voting)Hey, \nOverall risk details are here : https://docs.aave.com/risk/\nAnd generally each AIP to update asset parameters (including adding new) are included in the proposals and discussed at https://governance.aave.comDefiSaver and InstaDapp have tools to auto manage your position to avoid liquidation.I don't believe so.Can you please DM your transaction?Out of gas, did you edit the gas limit manually?Hmm okay I just re-simulated it with increased gas limit and it's OK.\nTry again, and edit the gas limit (not gas price) and change it to 125000 - the transaction should then work fine.Gas price of 4 gwei, it may not mine.https://etherscan.io/tx/0xe1090be47eaafe612b70835f350774bd9810f7a8f845247e3b4de9f31a01b21a, if it doesn't mine in 30 mins you may need to speed up in metamask.No need to cancel (you still pay for a cancel) just speed it up.I think it's too late now, just do a new one set gaslimit to 125000 and should be OK.Cool, just give it some time.You're welcome Looks cool, might want to cross-post into #ecosystemLooks like you didn't have AAVE in your wallet before the vote started?I think it makes sense to propose for v3 as v2 will soon be the legacy market on ETH. Best to start a new thread on the governance forum for initial discussion.Yeah someone will review and approve.The asset will likely be added via governance.Hey Rex, since the payment will come from the treasury I think this is well suited to a topic on the governance forum.\nhttps://governance.aave.com/@Nfteen - it's like you predicted the future If you have delegated your power, then someone else will vote on your behalf.I would expect that there would be a discussion on competing proposals in the governance forum to decide the optimal path. \n\nTechnically a situation could occur that both are accepted, and if so it would be down to timing, whichever is deployed last will be the one that is in effect today.\n\nP.S. Both suggest bullshit = Reject both.The minimum is 0.5 AAVEExecution can happen after 15 hours.Answered in DM - the answer is no, but that asset may be paused so all borrowing is paused.Flash loans were originally free, but now have a fee as voted by the DAO.Tap on the forum discussion link for more context, feel free to ask questions there too you'll get a better response from the authors of the change.Hey, what do you mean facilitator?Hey, what's up?\nI banned those other fake admins asking you to open a ticket etc.https://tenor.com/view/waiting-gif-23395435Just waiting on the guardians to execute it.What are you asking?Generally an idea will start on the governance forums, then go to snapshot for a sentient vote. But anyone who has 50 AAVE can submit a snapshot poll.What's up? How can we help?Should be OK if you held the AAVE before the vote start date.You are connected to snapshot with the same wallet?DM your wallet address please?Hey,\n\n1. Yes you need AAVE on ETH to vote on chain.\n2. Your Aave just needs to be there before the vote starts, once voted you can move it back.Check the link to telegram in the #grants channel and ask if they are interested Depends on the change, can be a couple days or longer.Check the pinned message for a link to telegram.You can email at wecare@aave.comBest to ask your question on the governance forum so you can get a direct answer/conversation with the proposer.Feel free to ask on the governance forum for an update.Are you talking about the USD value, or amount of ETH?\nPlease reply in English Best to ask on the forums if there is an update.Please open a ticket in #support  (on this server)There is no way to avoid paying network fees for transactions, you can use AAVE for a discount on the interest rate when borrowing GHO.\n\nIf you want to pay less network fees select a cheaper networ like Polygon or Arbitrum.Hey thanks for the questions, although we have a governance channel lol these are now best suited for the governance forum where discussions around governance mechanics take place.You can find this  at https://docs.aave.com/risk/https://app.aave.com/governance/ - connect your wallet and you can see who you are currently delegating to.gm fam,\nMany of the questions asked here lately are being redirected to the governance forums because that is where the conversations are happening.\n\nTherefore it makes sense that this channel will be read only from today.\n\nIf you have any governance questions we encourage you to search and ask on the governance forums.

Thanks Pablo!!Hi @Pablo Won't DM you first @DeFi Dude \nI saw that the guidance for unconfirmed AIPs have been renamed ARCs. My ARC for adding renBTC has received quite a bit of support and has been posted for nearly 4 weeks now. Would it be appropriate for me to open an AIP now? Do you have guidance for how to do so properly?Appreciate the reassurance. Do we have a standard operating producedure in place for future ARCs and AIPs?> more info on this is scheduled for next week\n@MarcZeller  awesome. Looking forward to the info. Let me know if I can help set up sentiment polling as well!https://governance.aave.com/t/listing-proposal-uma-lrc-omg-renbtc/1051?u=Defifrog is this the sentiment polling, or perhaps just an unofficial post?> don't worry @DeFi Frog you'll join a community sentiment poll in due time\n@MarcZeller Appreciate the clarification.

Since my original Arc back in 9/28, it appears renBTC has been added to a number of additional protocols (such as alphahomora, KeeperDAO, BadgerDAO(via crv)).

We can't let the VCs win. \n\nTHERE IS ZERO BENEFIT TO ANYONE FOR THIS PROPOSAL BEING REJECTED\n\nPlz aave holders,  vote yae!Most bond in circulation is staked in the dao and most of that is locked. How is it risky to add more of the market cap to aave? \n\nEveryone in crypto is taking a risk. This just seems like pure fear or pure greed. Def alternative motives at work here. \n\nIt also sets a horrible precedent for future projects trying to get listed on aave. Since 1 guy had more money than all of us in 2 wallets, and he is upset, so 1 guy cancels the proposal..... seems very decentralizedA whole proposal should not be able to be overthrown by 1 person using 2 wallets. That is a serious flaw in this process.  Their should be a limited amount of votes per wallet compared to the overall votesThis is purely an opionCuz is yae for me guyWell if it's flawed, then what's the point of using it?I'm saying that's a bad look. If something is wrong we should fix it.If not for barnbridge, but the future of all other projectsBc this guy can vote nae for every project except hisAnd that's cuckedThis isn't a lack of communication. It's 1 guy that's butt hurt with an agendaIdk how anyone could honestly argue that not having barnbridge on the aave protocol is positive for aave. Bc that's just false. \nStani is balls deep in barnbridge if that says anything, if he could vote, it would not be with the vcsTheir was no disagreementThat came after the vote, an excuseIs bc there is no reason, that guy wants his own project listed instead of barnbridge\nIt's a conflict of interest for him\nHe's not looking out for aaveThats the reason broPlease what you wantWhat you should be more upset about, is that this guy could do this to any project. Every project until his is ready.And thats severely cucked and flawYou can't argue that at allHorrible look. And you know what stani would vote.Mori how can you honestly argue against this?It's not fair at all what's happeningThe vietcong is very much a problemMori is prolly arthurox or his boyfriendWell that's how you act, protecting him like your in deepHow can you stand up for that?One guy is fucking up an awesome lending protocol voting system, and mori  is like eh, sounds like whining.\n\nBut your supporting something that will set the precedent for all future proposals. Something that is bad for the overall good of this community. \n\nYou seem like a pretty horrible person. IMOThis issue must be fixed. Should not be possible for one person to void an entire proposal bc they are unhappy in life. This is not the defi wayFighting the VCs like we fought the VietCongI think aave should change their name to say centralized financeVoting against the barnbridge proposal has ZERO benefit to aave or the aave communityYour vote should not be worthless, seems even more flawed in that sense serTheir should be a limit. A percentage of votes allowed for each proposal. A percentage compared to the overall # of voters. Someone should not be able to have a 70% vote, should be limited to 10% or less of the overall %\n\nBut then again he could move his money to 1000 wallets and vote the same...\n\nThis issue needs to be addressed. Bc this guy can basically control the entire market of what is added and not added to aave, bc the rest of the voters don't care or are afraid of gas pricesIs called tradfi then, not defi\nCentralized, but decentralizedNon constructive feedback is a matter of opinion. I'm an aave holder and a part of this community. \n\nThe issues that have been voiced today have relevance. A precedent is being set today that will affect all future proposals.i think its very sad point that one person with 2 wallets was able to cancel an entire proposal. this sets the precedent, and shows that one person can control what proposals are and are not taking place on aave, due solely to his opinions or whatever the reason may be. regardless of whatever the proposal is, it does not make sense that someone can have a majority of the votes in a DAO.this is not the defi wayRegardless of how many ppl vote or don't vote, 1 or 2 or even 3 ppl should not be able to control the entire vote just bc they have a higher % of votes. \n\nThere should be a limited vote amount compared to the overall vote. This would eliminate whale hoarding.

Where does all the income generated by aave go? I checked the governance fund contract, and it had ~$157k, while aave made $1.8mn in the last week alone.Thanks for the answer. Isnt the income of a financial lender computed as the difference of money made via lending and paid via interest to depositors? What is the meaning of income before you pay interest to depositors? Or is this extra income being paid to depositors because there arent many depositors?So basically the real profits of the platform are much smaller than $1.8 million n posted in weekly income? So the $167k in governance fund, increasing by roughly $10k/week, are the  profits/earnings of the platform?Thank you very much for the response, very appreciated LDR (loan to deposit) ratio for a bank to make money should be 80-90%, but its only 20% for aave. Are there any plans to increase utilisation? Because at 20% aave will barely make money to pay back depositors.That wasnt the question. A bank makes profits of x-y by taking x money from borrowers and paying y money to depositors. Now, if you have very little borrowing, like aave, your x-y is close to 0, which means no profits. X-Y for aave right now seems to be $10k/ week and thats very small. And its small because only 20% of all money is lended out. Note: I skipped flash loan income for simplicity.If you look at the governance fund, which is the profits of aave, youll find only $250k in it, and it increases by roughly $10k each week.Rates will only come down when more money is borrowed, right now only 20% is borrowed, there is no lack of money even now. If utilisation doesnt increases, more deposits will not lead to reduced rate of borrowings.No they wont borrow just because they get loans at cheap rates, and if they get loans at cheap rates then depositors will get cheap rates and theyll not be interested in depositing money in the protocol. Most people I know dont want to deposit already because interest rates are too low. Plus you cant bring down rates below traditional banking rates because then people will just cash out and deposit money in the bank.Interest rate of depositing/lending will always move together, but utilisation must become larger than 80%Interest rates for deposits/borrowings can only move together, but if you have high utilisation then you can bring borrowing rates lower without decreasing deposit rates, or in other words you can decrease the gap between the two, so again, utilisation must must must increase, period.If youre saying that aave doesnt have any idea or plans to increase utilisation then I understand that, but that doesnt mean its not important. I specifically wanted to know if there are any plans or estimates to grow utilisation Nope, it doesnt do that since AIP3 (or 2) I think.

People will borrow it they get loans at cheap interest rates. I think the focus should be on increasing deposits which will reduce the rates of borrowingInterest rates depend on the forces of demand and supply. The demand is not in our control but the supply is. We can bring down the interest rates of deposits to bring down the interest rates of borrowings.Interest rates on deposits of stablecoins right now is around 5-10% which is extremely high compared to banks. They have like 0.5-1% interest rate on deposits. There's just the smart contract risk which slowly goes away as time passes. And the gas fee problem for which we need L2 asapThe interest rates of deposits is also not in our control but it will come down as deposits growWith this balancer pool proposal passing, apy for SM should grow to 10-12% . Let's see how long it takes to get thereOr will it be new money entering the balancer pool So it's either new aave that will enter the balancer staking or the aave from the safety module.

Growing aave is our dividend.they're working on it https://github.com/aave/governance-crosschain-bridgesI just wonder why this all has to be a surprise. No signs of resistance until the actual vote, which really ends up wasting a lot of time since i dont think either side is trying to be malicious. AAVE owners whoever they are certainly should be entitled to their vote no matter how much we dont like the decision. hopefully this is just a growing pain of governance.Is there a plan for looping in large shareholders into conversations early? Do we need to actively court these shareholders for any future proposal?I think the fact remains that the BOND team thought they did their due diligence to make sure that they were going to pass the proposal 100% but it didnt because apparently you have to reach out to VCs individually since they wont read governance posts by themselves, which seems a little crazy to me. I think this is going to make governance very slow and cumbersome...It doesn't seem sustainable that these VCs can hold so much voting power without any active voice from them.idk.... these are the rules of the AAVE token. whats the point in complaining about itwell idk. i see governance as a WIP for the entire ecosystem so it wont be great. my point is that unless you're proposing a coup, theres no point in complaining about large votersidk. i think a lot of these problems can be solved with just better communication.like i think bond would have been happy to have proposed without being collateral if the VCs just made it knowni understand that, but i also think its unfair to paint the other side as not acting in the interest of AAVEits not like the VCs want to sink their own shipthey have a legitimate disagreement i think. its just a matter of... why is this disagreement happening NOW?that its too risky to list as a collateral assetexactlywhy did it come after the votethats what makes no sense to meoh please. as if he has time for those kinds of conspiracies when hes invested in like 50 projectsimo your accusations really lack any evidence at all. we're already gotten the culprits of the vote wrong in the first place, and here we go againleave your vendetta for VCs at the door unless you have some actual evidencemaybe you should solve the problem thenseriously, try implementing quadratic voting. see what happens....no but to me you sound like a whiny kid. everybody understands that this is a problem, and lots of people are trying to solve it but it's a slow process. and whining about VCs is not productive at allhere we go....yeah im awfulpoor meyou should question why so little AAVE Is being used to vote in the first place. There's plenty of outstanding shares that can outnumber the NO votes. \n\ni think a large problem is that it is expensive to even vote in the first place and providing liquidity with your AAVE renders you ineligible to vote. from what i know, these are problems that are on the way to being solved.i dont really think governance can work efficiently until the underlying voting and communication channels are solidWell I was thinking more that time would solve the problem. Right now I think a lot of people are essentially priced out of voting, but for VCs gas fees are nothing.I also recall hearing about projects that try to translate off-chain voting into on-chainisnt aave voting on chain?like i will say personally that i am priced out of voting. no way am i paying to withdraw my instadapp aave just to get a worthless vote in.eh, i accept it. small fish in a big ocean. its not a direct democracy, never has been. its not technically possible to make things fair since such a concept is subjective, but at least things are transparentWell, maybe putting another proposal up is trivial though....i was getting worried actually. its not really governance unless theres dramaI am eligible to vote with only 1.5 stkAAVE. I don't think there's a minimum. https://puu.sh/I5MGN/6fb8e3dbe4.pngAnother possibility is maybe your votes are delegated?It's broken. There are no stkAAVE rewards for LINK rn.

I notice the pools have shrunk another 17.5%, meaning a decline of 37.5% since 3 weeks ago.\n90% of AAVE's SUSD market comes out of the SAAVE pool, and it's over twice what is available to borrow.\nIf you scale the pools funding against the available DAI, USDC, and USDT to lend it's also not small. \nI'd like to get a view as to what people think and whether ther'es interest and conensus to advance the matter to the next step.https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-gauge-vote-incentives-on-convex-to-increase-stables-supply/5746Anyone actually comfortable with this bribe protocol? Why are they asking to stake AAVE in their token when they can see votes or ask for delegation? Anyone else concerned about potential rug, especially as no published audit still?They still can't seem to come up with a reasonable answer why they insist on staking when there's delegation built into AAVE governance. Have asked three times. At best, it creates unneeded smart contracts risk. At worst it exposed you to a rug. Either way, i fail to understand this design choice.Votium does not require you to stake anything. They see how your address voted (visible to all) and then you collect your bribe in an airdrop like interface... You can optionally delegate your vote to votium but that is a convenience and fallback in case you forget to vote. You can vote the desired way to earn the bribe or the other way to forgo it if you feel strongly. Importantly, you as an individual are always in control of both your principal token and your vote.\n\nNo matter how badly votium goes, your cvx is never in their smart contract. Worst case is you lose earned but not collected bribe if they get hacked/exploited.\n\nHere you stake the AAVE or stkaave in a bribe smart contract. If those are malicious or erroneous, those tokens are at risk. I see no need to organize things that way when you can delegate or vote the desired ways. So why are bribe so insistent on taking possession? They say some comment about front running that makes no sense to me. Unless their contract blocks you from withdrawing once they accept a bribe, in which case your tokens could be voting for something malicious and have no control to stop it.\n\nCustody and additional smart contract risk should require a strong justification. With delegation and publicly visible voting, i see no good reason to do this unless they are intending to not give your tokens back until after the vote. And not bothering to clarify that in tweets or Medium. That's the most innocent explanation I could find tbh. Unless you consider sloppy laziness as more innocent which is actually worse than malice in this space.If you don't vote you don't keep control. but even so AAVE governance has a built in delegation function, so they can still vote on your behalf.\n\nSomething feels off.", "output": "Positive"}, {"instruction": "Detect the sentiment of the content.", "input": "all I'm hearing is that delegation systems will become the next big thingif you're priced out, then at the very least delegate the votes\"you\" as a general *you*1. only count opt-in staked aave with slight incentive\n2. can delegate or vote on every proposal themselves\n3. if not delegating & not voting, but that aave in an 2 week non-yielding escrow wallet, to be returned to owner unstaked after 2 weeks\n\nnow not voting is an opportunity cost", "output": "Positive"}, {"instruction": "Detect the sentiment of the content.", "input": "there was no communication between large Aave holders and BB team nor with the rest of Aave community.

Is the fallback oracle mantained and live?\nThe address of fallback oracle can always be queried from Price Oracle available in deployed contracts section in dev docs. The price from fallback is used only if source is 0 or price is negative. So fallback oracle prices are not actively updated rather main security focus is to keep asset price source up to date.\nAnyway you can find fallback oracle here  https://etherscan.io/address/0x5b09e578cfeaa23f1b11127a658855434e4f3e09#code\n> 5. Are there any kind of delays on governance votes for users to withdraw their assets before they go live?\nDelays are based on type of proposals => https://docs.aave.com/developers/protocol-governance/governance#proposal-typesWhich time lock the proposal should be submitted is decided by the protocol and can be updated by the community.\nFor eg. Only pool admin can initialize new token in Aave market and the pool admin for main v2 market on ethereum is short lock executor. So, in this case a proposal has to go through short timelock executor else it cannot be executed/have no consequence. \nContracts are verified on etherscan so you can read the value of delay, grace period etc there.

There is a TON of stEth in the reserve, yet I can't borrow it? It will force users like me to euler.finance which is less battle-tested than aave so that is not ideal. wstETH is Euler's 3rd most borrowed asset after USDC and WETH so there is significant demand for this. On top of that, I would assume it actually improves Aave's overall safety if people can hedge and take the other side of this, as your chance of incurring bad debt due to steth would decrease? Can someone please let me know if there are plans to enable this, it just seems really bizarre to meIt's kinda mind blowing, there is $2.5B of stETH in aave, it is the MOST supplied asset in the protocol, and it can't be borrowed!! usually I've been very impressed by aave's risk assessments but i'm just in awe hereI don't have 500 aave so I can't make the proposal - but it seems absolutely crazy from the outside looking in. IIRC the justification Aave provided on twitter for this decision was \"we didn't think there was going to be borrow demand for stETH\". I do not believe that, and even giving you the benefit of the doubt that assumption is definitely not true now - go check euler.finance for proof - the borrow APY for wstETH is ~5.5% with $32.5M worth of it borrowed (over 50% utilization rate). \n\nIt is so obvious this is getting into systemic risk territory (not only for aave) but other protocols built on top of aave. From your governance \"Due to uncertainty around the stETH peg, Gauntlet proposes increasing stETH liquidation threshold. This will allow borrowers using stETH as collateral with more buffer in case stETH continues to depeg, and thus decrease the chances of liquidation cascades that lead to insolvency on the Aave platform\" https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/75/\n\nWhat is the real explanation for not enabling borrowing on stETH. Every other large asset on your platform can be borrowed, but the largest one can't!? And there is a ton of risk around stETH - you have smart contract risk, trust assumptions, merge uncertainty (not only around if/when the merge happens, but possible forks) and you are limiting the market to weigh risk here. Maybe someone with more skin in the game can turn this into a governance proposal - totally bizarre to meYup, unfortunately that is the case now. So there's probably nothing that can be done. If borrowing stETH was possible all along, like is the case for all other assets, then market participants would have been able to short this all along and prevent this bubble in the first place bc there was false confidence and an incorrect assumption that stETH is pegged 1:1 with eth. Hindsight 20/20 i guess . Now that it is crisis mode I wouldn't suggest making it borrowable personally, but i'm not a risk expert or anythingKeep in mind steth was slightly over 0.98 eth when i originally posted this", "output": "Positive"}, {"instruction": "Detect the sentiment of the content.", "input": "Hey guys!

Can partial anonymity be a way to start addressing group think?\n\nI understand that social reputation is important in qualifying the ideas but, it also gets in the way of viewing ideas based on its merits. In certain cases, we censor our controversial comments because it goes against the grain of the majority of DAOs and we tend to not point that out because of fear of social reprisal. Again, this may get in the way of having the most effective decision as some ideas are not considered (and that consensus is a more of a capitulation than general agreement that we have the best idea.)\n\nI believe that certain topics may require an anon space to assess the ideas by its merits rather than rely too heavily on the social representation (albeit it has an important role in the DAO). \n\nHow do you think anon forums would impact the quality of forum discussions?Hey @MarcZeller  - do you have any thoughts about the above by anychance?Awesome!

How many active delegates do you have? How their vote power is distributed? \n2. What are the stats of Delegate involvement (i.e. voting, percentage of token supply delegated, number of proposals voted on). Do you track this?\n3. Does Delegation help you to solve Governance problems? Is anyone doing something surprising with Delegates? Is something that you would like to improve or change?\n4. How did DAO track and communicate about Delegate involvement? (i.e with tooling etc)\n5. What is your assessment of the interfaces/tooling that community members can use to elect Delegates (i.e. ease for token holders to delegate, ease for delegates, how much do these interfaces affect the utilization of Delegates).\n6. How do you involve the community to delegate? (This is not easy to convince them).\n7. How you engage with your community (not delegates or entities)? I suppose that via Governance call. Any advise, help, suggestions how can be improved the governance call and how to engage more community in it ? \n\nSome of the questions i already found via your forum and tools, but would be great if you could answer them anyway. Maybe i missed something or you can point me out something relevant that i missed.Good day Pablo and thank you for your reply\nI asked h3lpfulBrother and he said that i can ask here because this is the best way...The key is that i was looking for feedback not from a specific entity or group, but i was looking the feedback from AAVE team.\nMost of the questions were addressed to AAVE team and i think that delegates are definitely not involved in:\n- How AAVE involve the community to delegate?\n-  Does Delegation help you to solve Governance problems?\nand etc...> but Im not really understanding the reasoning to ask a specific team when Aave protocol is decentralized and not ruled or owned by us\n\nthis looks like a ping-pong game:\n1. I have asked where is the best place and who could be the appropriate person who can help me with the answers... And i was told that i should use #governance channel. Ok.\n2. Asked in #governance   and i was redirected (surprise) from here to delegates ( how they could answer some of the questions i really don't know...)\n3.  Now i`m redirected for the 3rd time to another place..\nWow.. \n\n\n-  Does Delegation help you to solve Governance problems?\n-  How AAVE involve the community to delegate?\nThese questions are clearly not for the community nor for delegates.\n\nJust wonder how many times again i will be redirected...

Should I consider Aave governance v2 as the latest document for my reference? https://docs.aave.com/developers/v/2.0/protocol-governance/governance#proposal-life-cycle\n\nRegarding to Snapshot, as as per v2 documents, Snapshot voting is optional but highly recommended for consensus. However, within Snapshot settings, there is a min quorum set at 320K as well as 3 day voting period + 1 day voting delay. Since snapshot voting is not mandatory, I'm wondering how relevant this quorum and durations? Also historically, there are several snapshot votings took more than 5 days. Was there any update in 2023 regarding to duration?\n\nRegarding to onchain voting, Level2 requirements are updated with proposal 106 - https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/106/ - could you please confirm?\n\nSorry to ask many questions, but the confusion is that there are several documentations, not clear which one is the latest . so proposal 106 lowers the proposition threshold, quorum and vote differentials for long executor proposals, right?thanks for reply.
