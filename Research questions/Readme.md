# Research questions
1. Our study will focus on Aave, a native utility token of a top-one decentralization finance application on Ethereum, and mainly explore how to predict the price of Aave using social sentiment analysis. Besides, we consider a follow-up question, i.e., what is the relationship between the sentiment polarity of tweets and the price of Aave?
2. This study explores the possibility of applying Alpaca LoRA to the field of financial analytics, virtual currency price prediction and what are the advantages of this application?
## Significance
First of all, no actual studies have existed in related fields that put Alpaca LoRA into financial analysis, but three representative studies have been selected for this study in the field of putting big language models into financial analysis. This study draws from the contributions of these studies and improves upon their limitations, which is the importance of this study.

## Study 1: "Using GPT-3 for Stock Market Prediction"
This study uses the GPT-3 model to make predictions about stock prices in the financial markets. It uses the sample less learning capability of GPT-3 in the study, which provides a novel and promising approach to financial forecasting, especially in making analytical predictions in the absence of historical data in the relevant field.
- Contribution: This paper shows how large language models can be applied to financial forecasting tasks, especially in the field of stock markets. By utilizing the language comprehension and generation capabilities of GPT-3, the researchers were able to extract signals and information related to stock prices from large amounts of text data.
- Limitations: The data used in this study was not from a real-time updated database such as a forum and therefore does not reflect the real situation in the financial market. In addition, GPT-3 has limitations in handling time series data and understanding specific dynamics of the financial market, which does not allow for accurate forecasting.
- Improvement to that study: this study uses real-time data from forums, which can reflect the virtual currency market in a timely manner. Meanwhile, the Alpaca LoRA model has a better performance in dealing with time series data compared to the GPT-3 model, and has a better ability to update the database in real time as well as to handle new data.

## Study 2: "Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning Techniques for Cryptocurrency Price Prediction"
This study systematically describes how natural language processing techniques and machine learning algorithms can be combined to predict the price of cryptocurrencies. By collecting a large amount of cryptocurrency-related text data, including news articles, social media posts, and forum discussions, a set of prediction models were constructed to target the features of these data. In addition, this study compares the performance of different methods.
- Contribution: The researchers explored a variety of NLP techniques, such as text analytics, text generation, sentiment analysis, and topic modeling, as well as machine learning models, such as linear regression, decision trees, and neural networks, in financial analysis tasks, providing a technical foundation and object to learn from when putting Alpaca LoRA to use in virtual currency price prediction.
- Limitations: the models used in this study are not state-of-the-art and therefore do not perform as well as Alpaca LoRA and cannot perform as well as Alpaca LoRA with limited computational resources.
- Improvement to the study: Alpaca LoRA offers new possibilities in the areas of data processing, data augmentation, and computer resource utilization to achieve as good a performance as possible with limited computer resources.

## Study 3: "Forecasting Cryptocurrency Prices with Quantitative Analysis and Deep Learning Techniques"
This study explores the many ways in which quantitative analysis and deep learning techniques can predict cryptocurrency prices. Cryptocurrency related databases that include quantitative metrics such as price, trading volume, market capitalization, etc. are used in the study.
- Contribution: This article not only considers traditional economic and financial metrics, but also explores the use of deep learning models, such as recurrent neural networks and convolutional neural networks, in time series forecasting.
- Limitations: this article does not use real-time updated forum data and has some time limitations.
- Improvement to the study: Achieving more effective and credible predictive analytics by analyzing real-time forum data.
