# Social Media Sentiment Analysis Using a Fine-tuned Large Language Model
- This project is an initial preparation phase for social media sentiment analysis using a fine-tuned large language model. There are certain shortcomings, which will be addressed and improved in the future.
## Project Information:
- Author (in no particular order): Yiwei Liang; Jiaolun Zhou.
- Instructor:
- Project Summary: At this stage, the project uses the Llama2 , LoRA method and the Alpaca LoRA model for the study, based on user comments collected from online forums to train a model capable of making an analysis of cryptal price data based on daily forum data. The model is not able to analyze the cryptal price quantitatively, but only able to make "positive", "negative" and "neutral" judgments on the cryptal price trend. In the future, larger orders of magnitude of data and Llama30b can be used to correct this limitation.
